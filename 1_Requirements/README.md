# Introduction
We all have studied resistors in our electronics class. Resistor Color Coding uses colored bands to easily identify a resistors resistive value, percentage tolerance and temperature Coefficient. In our application we are using Color coding to give the resultant resistance, tolerance and temperature coefficient of the resistor.

## Research

### Automated Resistor Characteristics Generator features and benefits
The main aim of this application is to simplify the process of calculating different characteristics of a Resistor. This can work for 4 Band, 5 Band and 6 Band color coded resistors.




### Benefits
- It reduces the time that was wasted for calculating the characteristics of a resistor. 
- It is simple and quick way of identifying a resistors ohmic value no matter what it's size or condition.
